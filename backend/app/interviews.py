"""Interviews, and what the applications turned into.

Reads only. Writing an interview is four lines in main.py and needs no help;
what needs help is answering the questions the screens actually ask, and every
one of them is a variation on "what is next, and did the last one work".

The distinction this module exists to hold:

  draft       a client replied and somebody started the row from the job
              record. No time is agreed yet, so it is in no rate, no funnel and
              no count of what is coming — none of that is true of it. It is
              its own list on every screen, because a reply nobody has answered
              is a thing to chase, not a thing to forget.
  scheduled   somebody agreed a time. It has not happened yet.
  done        it happened. `outcome` then says what came of it.
  no_show     it did not happen and nobody said so beforehand.
  cancelled   called off. Never counted in a rate — a client who pulled out
              before the call did not reject anybody, and counting it as a
              rejection would make a quiet week look like a bad one.

A `stage` runs across all of that: screening, technical, assessment, final,
offer. Where a conversation died matters more than that it died — a team losing
everyone at technical has a different problem from one losing them at final —
so the stage is carried on every row and counted in `by_stage` below.

Rounds with the same client are chained through `previous_id`, and `chains()`
below turns that into the thing a screen shows: which round of how many this
is, and what came before it. A client who ran a screening call, a take-home and
two technical rounds before saying no is a different fact from four clients who
each said no after one call, and in a flat list those two are indistinguishable.

`awaiting_outcome` is the number worth putting on a screen: interviews whose
time has come and gone while the status still says `scheduled`. Nobody has said
how they went, so every rate below is quietly understated until they do.

All timestamps are stored UTC and read back on the team's clock, because a BD
in Karachi and a developer in Lisbon have to see one interview as the same
moment. models.working_label does that conversion once, on the server, so no
screen has to.
