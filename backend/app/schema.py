"""Bring an existing database up to the current shape.

There is no migration framework here on purpose — one file of plain SQLAlchemy
is easier to read, and to distrust, than a chain of generated revisions.

Version 1 keyed everything on the person who uploaded a sheet. Version 2 keys it
on the profile the job was applied under, because a person may run several and a
profile may be handed between people. That is not a column you can bolt on: the
old `applications` table carries UNIQUE(job_id, user_id), which forbids exactly
the case v2 exists to support — one person's two profiles both applying to the
same job. So the affected tables are rebuilt rather than altered.

Everything below is idempotent. A brand new database skips it entirely.
