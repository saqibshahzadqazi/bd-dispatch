"""The developer behind a profile, and what the applications turned into.

    pytest test_developer.py -v

A profile is an identity a client is sold. Behind it are two people who are not
the same person: the BD who runs the account and does the applying, and the
developer who sits the interview and writes the code. Everything here is about
keeping those two straight.

What is pinned down:

  * a developer sees the identities they are sold under and nothing else, and
    cannot work a list or hand in a sheet under any of them;
  * they keep their own resume, address and availability current, and cannot
    rename the identity or hand it to somebody else;
  * a time typed on the team's clock is the same time everybody reads back,
    whatever timezone the machine running this is set to;
  * one developer sold under two identities cannot be quietly double-booked;
  * an outcome is what moves the funnel, and a cancelled interview never counts
    as a rejection.

Shares a database with the rest of the suite — pytest imports app.main once, so
whichever module runs first decides where the data lives. Nothing here asserts
on a workspace-wide total it did not create, and every account and profile it
makes carries a name no other module uses.
