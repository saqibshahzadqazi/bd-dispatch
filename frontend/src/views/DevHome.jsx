/** A developer's own screen.
 *
 * The mirror of the BD dashboard, pointed the other way. A BD asks how much
 * went out; a developer asks what is coming back and where they have to be at
 * two o'clock. Same figures underneath — they are entitled to know how hard
 * their identities are being worked — but the thing at the top is the next
 * interview, not the row count.
 *
 * A developer books here too. A client that found them directly emails them
 * directly, and making them ask somebody else to type it in is how a reply sits
 * unanswered for a day. What stops one reply becoming two rows is not a
 * permission but the clash check, which fires on any booking against the same
 * developer whichever identity it was made under.
 *
 * The half only they can answer is still the half the screen leads them to:
 * whether the call happened, what came of it, and how it actually went.
 *
 * A developer may be sold under several identities, and the question they ask
 * is usually about one of them — what has Khuram got today. So the diary
 * narrows to one profile at a time, and the figures narrow with it rather than
 * staying whole and quietly disagreeing with the list underneath them.
 *
 * Not behind the dashboard switch a BD's figures sit behind. That switch
 * exists so nobody is measured without somebody deciding to measure them; this
 * is a calendar and a resume, and withholding it only means nobody turns up.
